# Geeks for Weeks Code
Geeks for Weeks was a initiative that lasted from July 2022 to August 2022 that covered the basics of programming in Python, from setup of the code environment (using Python and VS Code), to basic variables and mathematics, logic design, if-statements, for loops, while loops, and eventually problem solving up to "FizzBuzz".

This repository houses the code used during lessons.
